# üåå **mirrorwake**
Hello! I'm **mirror**, a lifetime tech hobbyist and aspiring DevOps engineer.

As a tinkerer, I have in-depth knowledge of some niche areas. However, I have a lot of information gaps that I'm trying to fill, be they professional gaps like Kubernetes, or just little things I skipped . This repo will be filled with my experiments and projects, and my Github Page (once set up) will be used to document my hardware experiments that don't make sense in their own repo. I spend a lot of my time tinkering and experimenting but up to this point haven't documented many of my exploits, so I hope to treat this as a living portfolio.

üõ†Ô∏è **Currently exploring:**
- Nix & flakes (Nix is very cool!)
- Ways to improve performance and automation of my home lab (Docker on an old PC only gets you so far)
- Post-quantum cryptography and Linux security (Can't be too paranoid!)
- Deepening my understanding of Linux and Unix-like systems (Every device I own must bend to my will, and if it does not by default then I will learn what I must to make it do so)

üíª **Hardware projects in the pipeline** (expect blog posts!)
- ThinkPad T420 Resurrection (Motherboard bricked, but fixable! Probably? Hopefully??)
- HP T530 Thin Client Cluster Resurrection (All 5 arrived in a strange, locked down, PXE-only state, but I think I can solve it.)
- Thermal printer pipeline (Weather and fortunes on the go! I think it's cool. It'll make sense.)
