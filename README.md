Hello! I'm **mirror**.

I spend a lot of my time tinkering and solving problems (both serious and nitpicky) and have gained a lot of skills in lots of niche areas along the way. The downside to this approach is I have a lot of gaps in my knowledge that a more traditional route would have filled me in on. This page is both a personal repository as well as a documentation of my studies and projects.

ðŸ’» **Hardware projects in the pipeline**
- ~~ThinkPad T420 Resurrection (Motherboard bricked, but fixable! Probably? Hopefully??)~~ UPDATE: Successfully resurrected, attempting to fix firmware-level networking issues now.
- ~~HP T530 Thin Client Cluster Resurrection (All 5 arrived in a strange, locked down, PXE-only state, but I think I can solve it.)~~ UPDATE: Apparently none of these were sold? Ever?? I guess HP doesn't flash pre-boot binaries until units are prepared for sale as a theft deterrent or something. This has mutated into a reverse engineering problem, and I totally think I'm capable of solving it. However, I have other priorities so the project has been temporarily shelved.
- Thermal printer pipeline (Weather and fortunes on the go! I think it's cool. It'll make sense once it's working.)
